# Real-Time Face, Age, Gender, and Emotion Detection System

This project is a real-time detection system that identifies faces, predicts gender, estimates age, and analyzes emotions in video feeds. It utilizes OpenCV for computer vision, pre-trained models for age and gender prediction, and a deep learning model for emotion detection.

## Project Overview

The project provides valuable insights into demographics and emotional responses, which could be useful in fields like retail, market analysis, and user experience research. It uses:
- **OpenCV's DNN module** for face detection.
- **Pre-trained Caffe models** for age and gender classification.
- **Keras** to load a pre-trained emotion detection model.

### Main Components

- **`age_gender_detection.py`**: Loads pre-trained models for age and gender classification, processes the input face, and predicts age and gender.
- **`detect_faces.py`**: Uses a Haar cascade to detect faces in real-time from a video feed.
- **`emotion_detection.py`**: Loads a deep learning model for emotion detection and predicts emotions for detected faces.
- **`real_time_detector.py`**: Integrates face, age, gender, and emotion detection to process each frame of the video feed and display results in real-time.
- **`utils.py`**: Contains utility functions for loading models and drawing labels on the video frames.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project and run it on your machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face_gender_age_emotion_detection.git
cd face_gender_age_emotion_detection
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Python libraries from `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** Ensure that you have OpenCV with the `opencv-contrib-python` package to support DNN modules and Caffe model loading.

### Step 4: Download Large Model Files
Due to GitHubâ€™s file size limits, the following large model files are not included in the repository. Please download them from the links below and place them in the `data/` directory:

- `age_net.caffemodel` - Age detection model ([Download here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1CibG5LWevqiM0oQ0pe2sznvyqjDUj8Da))
- `gender_net.caffemodel` - Gender detection model ([Download here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1CibG5LWevqiM0oQ0pe2sznvyqjDUj8Da))
- `emotion_model.hdf5` - Emotion detection model

### Step 5: Run the Project
Use the following command to start the real-time face, age, gender, and emotion detection:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will open a video feed from your webcam, detect faces, and display the predicted gender, age range, and emotion for each detected face. Press `q` to exit the application.

## How It Works

- **Face Detection**: The program captures each frame from the video feed and uses a Haar cascade to detect faces.
- **Gender and Age Prediction**: For each detected face, the program uses a pre-trained Caffe model to classify gender and estimate age.
- **Emotion Detection**: The program uses a Keras model to classify the emotion of the detected face.
- **Display**: The results are displayed in real-time on the video feed, with bounding boxes around faces and labels for gender, age, and emotion.
